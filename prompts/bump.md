You are adapting TauCetiProject/TauCeti, an AIs-welcome Lean 4 library downstream of Mathlib, to a Mathlib bump on pull request #__PR__. You are in a checkout of the repo, already on the PR's branch. A bot opened this PR to move the Lake pins (`lake-manifest.json` and/or `lean-toolchain`) forward to a newer Mathlib, and the `build` check is red because `TauCeti/` has not caught up to the Mathlib API at the new pin. Work autonomously to completion: make CI green by adapting `TauCeti/`, without reverting the bump and without weakening the library.

## The pins are the point — keep them
- The bumped `lake-manifest.json` / `lean-toolchain` on this branch ARE the change under review. Do NOT revert them, do NOT re-pin to an older Mathlib, do NOT touch the lakefile. Your job is to make `TauCeti/` build against the Mathlib the bot pinned.
- If the new pin is genuinely unworkable (e.g. a Mathlib change that can't be adapted without a redesign), stop and report that, rather than reverting the bump or gutting the library.

## Reproduce and adapt
```
lake exe cache get
git fetch -q origin main
shim_args=(--fail-on-available); base_shims="$(mktemp)"; base_root="$(mktemp -d)"
base_ref="$(git merge-base origin/main HEAD)"
if git show "$base_ref":TauCeti/mathlib-shims.json > "$base_shims" 2>/dev/null; then git archive "$base_ref" TauCeti | tar -x -C "$base_root"; shim_args+=(--base-manifest "$base_shims" --base-root "$base_root"); fi
if [ -f scripts/check-expired-mathlib-shims.py ]; then python3 scripts/check-expired-mathlib-shims.py "${shim_args[@]}"; fi
rm -f "$base_shims"; rm -rf "$base_root"
lake build
lake exe axioms
```
- Read the build failures. The usual cause is a renamed/moved/retyped Mathlib lemma or a changed signature. Fix each by updating the `TauCeti/` proof or statement to the new Mathlib API. Prefer the smallest correct change.
- The shim-expiry command may be the only failing check even when `lake build` succeeds. Its annotations name exact Mathlib replacements and affected sources. Migrate only the superseded declarations/imports, preserve or re-home source-only API, and update `TauCeti/mathlib-shims.json` in the same source-only change. The checker derives each inherited source's declaration surface from the PR merge base and ratchets its probes until that surface is migrated, deleted, or re-homed under an entry preserving those probes, so never make the check green by merely deleting probes or changing an exact target to a speculative/landing sentinel.
- For a failing check's logs: `gh pr checks __PR__ --repo TauCetiProject/TauCeti`, then `gh run view <run-id> --repo TauCetiProject/TauCeti --log-failed`.
- If the failure is genuinely transient infra (e.g. a cache fetch timeout), both `lake build` and the shim-expiry command succeed locally, and the failed logs contain no actionable migration, push an empty commit to re-trigger CI (`git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: re-trigger CI"`) and say so.

## Rules of the repo (hard constraints)
- Adapt code under `TauCeti/`. Do NOT edit the root `TauCeti.lean`: it is intentionally empty, and the lakefile's glob (`TauCeti.*`) builds every module under `TauCeti/` without it. The only files outside `TauCeti/` you may leave changed are the pins the bot already bumped. Do NOT touch `Scripts/`, `.github/`, or the lakefile (`lakefile.toml`/`lakefile.lean`).
- Use `namespace TauCeti` for project-specific declarations. When extending an existing Mathlib type, place its operations and associated API in that type's existing namespace (for example, root `ContMDiffMap`) so receiver dot notation works. Do not nest that namespace under `TauCeti` or add compatibility aliases solely to keep the old namespace. Preserve valid type-namespace placement during CI fixes, rebases, and toolchain bumps.
- **Never write to the roadmaps.** Do not open a PR or an issue in `TauCetiProject/TauCetiRoadmap`; creating or changing a roadmap needs human attention. If your work needs one, say so in your report and stop.
- Must end green AND axiom-clean: no `sorry`, no `native_decide`, no new axioms (allowlist: `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`), no `maxHeartbeats` overrides, and never silence a linter (e.g. with `set_option ... false`) to force the build green.

## Verify before pushing (all three MUST pass)
```
lake exe cache get
git fetch -q origin main
shim_args=(--fail-on-available); base_shims="$(mktemp)"; base_root="$(mktemp -d)"
base_ref="$(git merge-base origin/main HEAD)"
if git show "$base_ref":TauCeti/mathlib-shims.json > "$base_shims" 2>/dev/null; then git archive "$base_ref" TauCeti | tar -x -C "$base_root"; shim_args+=(--base-manifest "$base_shims" --base-root "$base_root"); fi
if [ -f scripts/check-expired-mathlib-shims.py ]; then python3 scripts/check-expired-mathlib-shims.py "${shim_args[@]}"; fi
rm -f "$base_shims"; rm -rf "$base_root"

```
Iterate until green. Never push red.

Run each command synchronously in a single foreground shell invocation with a generous timeout. Do
not use the interactive `write_stdin`/session-polling tool for a long-running cache or build command:
its transient process handle can disappear before the result is returned. If a tool call yields a
session id anyway, rerun the command with a longer foreground timeout rather than polling it.

**Do this synchronously, in this one turn.** Run these commands in the FOREGROUND and wait for each to finish — do NOT background the build and then end your turn expecting to be resumed. You are running non-interactively; nothing will resume you, so a build left running in the background is abandoned and the round ends with nothing committed or pushed. Do not yield, stop, or end your turn until you have committed and pushed (below). If publication is blocked, preserve the local candidate and report the exact blocker.

## Submit
If an operator configured a pre-push check, the safe wrapper runs it synchronously against the committed candidate. Wait for its terminal result; do not launch a duplicate validation or bypass a failed check. A failed check or push preserves local work. Diagnose the exact error: permission and transport failures do not establish a concurrent branch update.

- Commit the adaptation with an informative conventional subject (`<type>: <subject>`, imperative present) and a substantive body. Use real line breaks; do not add an AI co-author trailer or literal `\\n` escapes.
- Push with the project's safe wrapper — and ONLY the wrapper:
  ```
  "__BIN__/git-safe-push"
  ```
  This compare-and-swaps the PR branch against the head you started from, so a concurrent agent's work is never silently clobbered. Do NOT run a raw `git push` (nor `--force` / `--force-with-lease`); the wrapper is the only sanctioned push. If it reports the branch moved or the lease was lost, publication is blocked — STOP and say so; do not work around it. A successful push updates the PR; CI re-runs automatically.
- Do NOT open a new PR; do NOT touch files outside `TauCeti/` (and the already-bumped pins).

## Report
End with a concise summary: which Mathlib changes broke or superseded `TauCeti/`, how you adapted each, and the exact shim-expiry / `lake build` / `lake exe axioms` result lines proving green + axiom-clean. Do not claim green unless you saw it.
