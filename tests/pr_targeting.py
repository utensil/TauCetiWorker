"""`--pr N[,N...]`: pointing a round at named pull requests instead of letting it pick off the queue.

The flag exists so an operator can say "work on #412" and get that, or an honest answer about why
not. The properties that make it safe to hand to an operator, and that this suite pins down:

  - it only ever REMOVES. A named PR the survey passed over does not become actionable by being
    named, so the attempt budgets, the daily review cap, a peer's in-progress review and the branch
    claims all still hold. `--pr` is a filter over what the round was already willing to do.
  - it composes with `--only` by intersection, and refuses up front when the two cannot both be
    honoured (`--only roadmap --pr 5` names a PR that does not exist yet).
  - it drops the two work units that name no existing PR. A targeted round that finds nothing to do
    on its targets must not fall through to authoring an unrelated roadmap PR; the operator asked
    about those PRs, and doing something else is the wrong answer to that request.
  - when nothing is actionable it says why, PR by PR, and exits without progress.
  - unlike the two review throttles, this one is operator-facing, so it IS documented.

Dependency-free; no network. The end-to-end cases drive the real run_round with survey and dispatch
stubbed, so they test the cascade's actual control flow rather than a re-description of it.

Exit 0 = all cases agree; 1 = a mismatch.
