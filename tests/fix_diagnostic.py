"""`fix_disposition` classifies a tended PR for the `fix` stage and phrases why it isn't actionable.

This is the signal behind Bryan's report: he opened PR #470, ran a one-shot `work --only fix` minutes
before the review bots posted the scoreboard, and got a bare "no eligible work this round under
--only=fix" with no hint that the PR was simply awaiting its first review. The survey now records a
one-line reason for every tended PR that isn't a fix candidate, and a fix-focused worker logs them.

`fix_disposition` is the pure decision: given the scoreboard meta, the current head, whether the build
is green, the authoritative `blocking` predicate (rs.ledger_blocking), and the per-head fix-attempt
count, it returns (disposition, reason). The blocking rule itself is NOT re-implemented here — it is
passed in — so this function and `ledger_blocking` can never drift. Dependency-free.

Exit 0 = all cases agree; 1 = a mismatch.
