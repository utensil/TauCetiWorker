"""The one candidate a round spends on is re-read from GitHub first.

The survey triages on cached comment reads keyed to each PR's `updatedAt` (see
review_state_freshness), which is what stops a round paying per open PR. That key cannot see a
deleted comment, so the candidate the cascade actually picks is re-read live in dispatch() before
anything that costs money: a peer may have taken the head, the board may have been reviewed since,
the contested reply may be gone. A candidate that no longer stands is DECLINED, which is the
cascade's existing "offered but not taken" path — the round moves to the next candidate rather than
spending on a stale one.

Exit 0 = all cases agree; 1 = a mismatch.
