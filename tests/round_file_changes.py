"""What a round wrote is recorded from git, not recovered from the transcript.

"What did this round actually write?" and "did it build after its last edit?" were not answerable
from a log. An agent edits through a structured tool, a `python3 - <<EOF` heredoc, or `apply_patch`,
and a long command is truncated before its target path is reached. Recovering the paths by
pattern-matching command text was tried and withdrawn: it claimed a write for `jq '.a > .b'` and
missed `2>err.log`, and no amount of regex fixes that without a shell parser. git already knows
exactly.

Pinned here:

  1. A round that committed reports its committed files, from `pre..HEAD`.
  2. A round that left the tree dirty reports that separately, including untracked files, which is
     the case a `git diff` alone would miss entirely.
  3. Both at once, for a round that committed and then kept editing.
  4. A clean round says nothing, so the log does not grow a line per round for no reason.
  5. Output is bounded, and says how many it elided.
  6. Every git failure is silent: this is a log line and must never fail a round that succeeded.

Exit 0 = all assertions hold; 1 = a mismatch.
