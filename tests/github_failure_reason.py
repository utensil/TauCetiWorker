"""A round aborted by a GitHub read must say WHICH failure aborted it.

The survey captures gh's own stderr when `gh pr list` fails, but run_round used to discard it and raise
a fixed "gh pr list failed (GitHub API?)". That question mark was the whole problem: the answer was an
HTTP 504 from the GraphQL gateway (the survey's statusCheckRollup query runs ~10s and the gateway gives
up around 11), and an operator reading the dashboard had no way to tell that from a broken credential.
Dependency-free: the survey is stubbed, so no network and no gh.

Exit 0 = all cases agree; 1 = a mismatch.
