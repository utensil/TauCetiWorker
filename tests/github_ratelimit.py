"""gh_run waits out a GitHub rate limit and retries, rather than failing the round and discarding the
agent's (expensive) work.

A 403 mid-round used to fail the round outright — and, for a review, count against the review-ERROR cap
that escalates a healthy PR to a human (the #302 false-escalation in the field log). Now a rate-limited
`gh` call sleeps until the limit clears and retries in place, bounded by GH_INROUND_WAIT so it can't blow
ROUND_TIMEOUT; the loop-level preflight (cmd_loop) waits out the longer hourly primary reset. This harness
pins gh_run's decisions without touching the live API: a scripted FakeRun replays (returncode, stderr)
tuples and a stubbed sleep records the waits.

Exit 0 = all cases agree; 1 = a mismatch.
