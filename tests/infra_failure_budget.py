"""A provider outage must not spend a PR's fix budget.

TauCetiProject/TauCeti#1434 was retired as "fix attempts are spent (3/3) — needs a human" after three
consecutive fix rounds died to `API Error: 529 Overloaded`. The agent never attempted the fix once, so
all three attempts were charged for a failure that had nothing to do with that PR. Rounds 55, 56 and 58
of one day's log, one PR, permanently flagged for a human because the provider was busy.

Two halves are checked here: the classifier only calls a failure transient when it really is one (a
dead credential must stay charged and stay loud), and the refund hands the counters back and pauses the
round rather than letting the loop march on. Exit 0 = every case agrees; 1 = a mismatch.
