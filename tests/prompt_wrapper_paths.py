"""The write wrappers are named by absolute path in every prompt that pushes.

PATH is not a reliable channel to a codex round. Codex runs its shell as `bash -lc`, and a login
shell re-runs the system profile; on NixOS /etc/profile REPLACES $PATH unless $__ETC_PROFILE_SOURCED
arrives with the environment, so the `HERE/scripts` prefix host_agent_argv exports is dropped. The
field evidence: `git-safe-push: command not found` on 131 of 1525 codex transcripts and none of 1161
claude ones (claude uses a non-login shell); 120 of those rounds burned turns locating the wrapper
after a green build, and 11 never pushed at all. The prompts therefore spell the wrapper as
`__BIN__/git-safe-push`, which no shell startup file can take away.

This harness pins the four properties that keep that true:

  1. `wrapper_bin()` names the staged directory on the host and `/opt/round` in bubble — the two
     places run_in_bubble copies the wrappers to.
  2. Every prompt that invokes a wrapper invokes it through `__BIN__`, never bare.
  3. Every bundled prompt renders with no placeholder left, using exactly the keys its call site
     passes — a leaked `__BIN__/git-safe-push` is the very failure being fixed.
  4. The bump and CI-repair prompts run the expired-shim gate and tell the worker how to migrate.
  5. `fill_prompt` raises on an unfilled placeholder in a bundled prompt, and stays quiet for a
     prompt served from elsewhere (TauCetiProgress owns the progress prompt's placeholder set).

Exit 0 = all assertions hold; 1 = a mismatch.
