"""tauceti_worker — the Tau Ceti worker.

Bare `tauceti` opens a dashboard + launcher; `tauceti work [--loop]` does the work (one round, or
the driver loop); `tauceti status` prints the read-only survey.

The worker acts on TauCetiProject/TauCeti as the authenticated `gh` account, and treats that
account's own PRs as the ones it tends. Each round does exactly ONE unit of work, chosen in
priority order: rebase -> bump -> progress -> fix-ci -> fix -> review -> roadmap.

This package was split from a single-file script for navigability. The split is behaviour-
preserving. For both the test harness (which reaches `tauceti_worker.<NAME>`) and the historical
single-module API, every submodule's top-level name is flattened into the package namespace below;
the submodules themselves stay importable (e.g. `tauceti_worker.github`) so a test can monkeypatch
a function on the module that actually looks it up.
