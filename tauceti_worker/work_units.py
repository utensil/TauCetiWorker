    human (or a peer worker with different pacing) can take it first. A default worker must never
    need them, and an undocumented flag is one we can change or retire without a deprecation.

    Both default to 0 (off) and can only ever REMOVE candidates: they change WHEN a reviewer fires,
    never what it reviews, how it reviews, or any other stage. `status` and the dashboard survey
    deliberately do not apply them — they report the queue as it is, not what this worker's throttles
    would pick from it.

    The queue depth is measured BEFORE the age filter, so `--review-min-queue 3` means "three PRs are
    awaiting review", the quantity the operator sees, rather than "three are old enough yet".
    A PR whose `build` status carries no readable timestamp has no known waiting time and is left
