        We DON'T gate on the comment author's repo association. `author_association` is viewer-dependent:
        a reviewer who is a PRIVATE org member reads as MEMBER to themselves but as CONTRIBUTOR/NONE to an
        outside contributor, so an association filter silently discarded legitimate scoreboards for every
        unprivileged contributor (Bryan's PR #470: a real kim-em scoreboard, four blocking rubrics, that
        his worker treated as "no scoreboard at this head" — so `fix` never ran). The cost of trusting any
        marked scoreboard is bounded: this meta only drives the worker's OWN review/fix eligibility on its
        OWN PRs; the merge gate reads the authoritative, write-restricted TauCetiData records, not this
        comment, so a forged comment cannot merge anything. The residual risk is a forged all-green
        scoreboard suppressing a review — which a forger can't parlay into a merge and which self-heals on
        the next push (its head_sha stops matching). A FETCH FAILURE with a prior cache value → serve the
        stale value (stale-but-real beats a phantom '{}'); a SUCCESSFUL fetch that finds no scoreboard
        returns '{}' even with a cache, so a scoreboard that was deleted/edited away (or a forged one a
        worker briefly cached) can't be served as fresh past the TTL.
