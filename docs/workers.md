# Persistent workers

Persistent workers are declarative. You describe the workers you want in
`workers.toml`, and a manager process reconciles reality against that file:
starting missing workers, stopping removed ones, restarting changed ones, and
backing off repeated failures. They do not belong to a terminal session.

## Quickstart

Nothing needs to exist first. `workers add` creates the config, writes the
definition, and starts a manager:

```bash
tauceti workers add                        # an enabled worker1, the whole cascade
tauceti workers add reviewer --only review # a focused, named worker
tauceti workers                            # desired and actual state
tauceti workers logs --follow reviewer     # its durable console log
```

Day-to-day controls:

```bash
tauceti workers disable reviewer   # persist desired stopped state
tauceti workers enable reviewer    # and start it again
tauceti workers restart reviewer   # without changing desired state
tauceti workers remove reviewer    # drop the definition and stop it
```

## Editing the file directly

`workers add` cannot express every field, and it rewrites the file in canonical
form, dropping comments and hand formatting. To keep those, or to set a field
`add` does not cover, edit the file and apply it:

```bash
tauceti workers edit          # $VISUAL, else $EDITOR, else vi
tauceti workers apply --check # validate without reconciling
tauceti workers apply         # reconcile, starting a manager if needed
```

`workers edit` does not start a manager on its own; `workers apply` is the
explicit follow-up. A later `enable`, `disable`, `add`, or `remove` normalizes
the file again, so comments do not survive one.

A small configuration might look like this. The repository also includes
[`workers.toml.example`](../workers.toml.example).

```toml
version = 1

[[workers]]
id = "worker1"
enabled = true

[[workers]]
id = "worker2"
enabled = true
agent = "codex"
only = ["rebase", "review"]
ignore_quota = true
```

You can edit `workers.toml` while the manager is running. It reloads the file
each cycle. If your edit does not validate, the manager keeps the last good
generation, leaves running workers alone, and says so once:

```
tauceti workers: invalid configuration; keeping last good generation: ...
```

## Where the config lives

The first of these that is set wins:

| Source | Path |
| --- | --- |
| `tauceti workers --config PATH` | exactly that file |
| `$TAUCETI_WORKERS_CONFIG` | exactly that file |
| `$TAUCETI_CONFIG_HOME` | `$TAUCETI_CONFIG_HOME/workers.toml` |
| `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tauceti/workers.toml` |
| macOS default | `~/Library/Application Support/tauceti/workers.toml` |
| otherwise | `~/.config/tauceti/workers.toml` |

`--config` belongs to `tauceti workers` itself, not to the action, so it goes
before the action name: `tauceti workers --config ./workers.toml apply`.

Writes take an `flock` on a sibling `workers.toml.lock`, then replace the file
atomically, so concurrent CLI and dashboard mutations serialize instead of
clobbering each other.

## `workers.toml` reference

The file supports two top-level keys. `version` is required and must be `1`;
`workers` is an optional array of tables and defaults to an empty array. Any
other top-level key is an error, as is any unrecognized field inside a
`[[workers]]` table. Duplicate ids are rejected.

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | required | `[a-z0-9-]+`, at most 40 characters; namespaces the worker's state, checkout, review store, and logs |
| `enabled` | bool | `true` | Desired running state. `false` stops the worker without forgetting it |
| `agent` | string | `"auto"` | `auto`, `codex`, `claude`, `kiro`, `deepseek`, or `minimax` |
| `only` | string list | `[]` | Work phases: `rebase`, `bump`, `progress`, `fix-ci`, `fix`, `review`, `roadmap`. Empty means the whole cascade |
| `sandbox` | string | `"host"` | `host` or `bubble`. Progress-report rounds always run on the host |
| `ignore_quota` | bool | `false` | Skip soft pacing. Provider hard limits still apply; an `auto` worker cannot launch with this enabled |
| `auto_refresh` | bool | `false` | Renew this worker's Claude access token when it expires, instead of parking until a human runs `claude`. Only safe when nothing else uses the same credential file — the refresh token is single-use. See [quota and pacing](quota.md) |
| `roadmap_only` | string | unset | The single roadmap area for roadmap rounds. `""` means all areas; unset means a fresh random area each round |
| `roadmap_skip` | string list | `[]` | Roadmap areas to exclude. `roadmap_only` wins on overlap |
| `roadmap_extra_identities` | string list | `[]` | Extra GitHub logins whose claimed intentions count as this worker's own |
| `review_roadmap` | string list | `[]` | Roadmap labels admitted to review, forwarded only as `--review-roadmap` CLI arguments |
| `review_pr` | positive integer list | `[]` | Explicit PRs admitted to review, unioned with `review_roadmap` and forwarded only as `--review-pr` CLI arguments |
| `review_author` | string list | `[]` | GitHub authors as `login` or `login:decimal-probability` (default `1.0`), sampled once per round and then unioned with `review_roadmap` and `review_pr`; forwarded only as `--review-author` CLI arguments |
| `tend_scope` | string | `"author"` | Maintenance PR scope: `author` preserves legacy author-wide tending; `owned` tends only PR numbers recorded for this worker id |
| `max_open_prs` | positive integer | `8` | Roadmap authoring backpressure for this worker only; changing it does not affect other workers |
| `respect_claims` | bool | `true` | Whether to avoid intentions others have claimed |
| `source` | string | unset | Supplementary repository directory or URL. Requires `roadmap` in `only` and a non-empty `roadmap_only` |
| `author_model` | string | unset | Exact authoring model. Requires an `agent` other than `auto` |
| `author_effort` | string | unset | Authoring reasoning effort for Codex, Claude, or Kiro. Requires an explicit `agent` |
| `pace` | string | unset | Pacing curve as `time%:budget%` points, for example `0:10,50:70,90:90`; rejected by `apply --check` if malformed |
| `stream` | bool | `false` | Keep the agent transcript in the console log instead of a separate file |
| `isolate_home` | bool | `false` | Force credential isolation for the id `default`; every other id already enables it |
| `restart` | string | `"always"` | `always` after any exit, `on-failure` after a nonzero exit, or `never`; explicit restart and re-enable still work |
| `env` | table of strings | `{}` | Extra environment for this worker's process tree, for settings with no flag of their own. Values must be quoted strings, names POSIX-portable, and the table at most 16 KB. The variables the worker sets itself (`TAUCETI_MANAGED`, `TAUCETI_LOG_FILE`, `TAUCETI_PARENT_PIPE_FD`, `TAUCETI_DATA_HOME`, `TAUCETI_TEND_SCOPE`, `TAUCETI_PR_RECEIPT_FILE`, and the runtime-status path) are rejected. **Not a secret store** — see below |

The manager fingerprints each definition. It stops a worker when `enabled`
becomes false and restarts an enabled worker when any other field changes,
without disturbing unchanged workers.

`env` exists for running one worker differently from its peers when the
difference has no flag: an A/B of a build setting, for instance. It is part of
the fingerprint, so editing it restarts that worker and leaves the others alone,
and both `workers status` and the dashboard name the variables it sets, so the
odd worker out is visible rather than mysterious.

Review allowlists remain command-local from the Worker's perspective. The
manager stores launcher desired state, then emits `review_roadmap`, `review_pr`, and
`review_author` only as explicit CLI arguments to the loop; it does not translate
them into environment variables or mutable worker state. Put a private
`workers.toml` under the operations project when the approval list itself is
private.

Author probabilities are decimal values from `0.0` through `1.0`, not
percentages. Each round uses a timestamp seed to compute the final allowed-author
array before the existing roadmap OR explicit-PR OR author union is applied.

### Owned maintenance scope

Set `tend_scope = "owned"` for every non-review maintenance Worker that shares a
GitHub identity with another Worker. Rebase, fix-CI, fix, and bump then consider
only PR numbers recorded for that Worker ID. The record lives at
`$TAUCETI_INSTANCES_DIR/<worker-id>/owned-prs`, or by default
`~/.tauceti/instances/<worker-id>/owned-prs`; it is one strict comma-separated
line of positive PR numbers. Roadmap PR creation records its number through the
sanctioned `gh-safe-pr-create` wrapper and atomically updates the file. Missing,
malformed, or duplicate state fails closed to an empty maintenance queue; it is
never treated as author-wide scope. The state contains no branch, head, or account metadata.

Put no secrets in it. The values are stored in plain `workers.toml`, and the
whole worker definition is handed to its runner on a command line, where any
process running as you can read it. Credentials belong in the provider
mechanisms `tauceti` already uses (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME`,
`KIRO_API_KEY`), which keep them in files rather than argv. Status output prints
only the variable names for the same reason.

```toml
[[workers]]
id = "worker5"
enabled = true
# Restore a previously built module from Lake's local store instead of recompiling it.
env = { LAKE_ARTIFACT_CACHE = "1", LAKE_RESTORE_ARTIFACTS = "1" }
```

`LAKE_RESTORE_ARTIFACTS` belongs with that first variable rather than being
optional: with the artifact cache writable, Lake may keep a build product in its
store instead of the build directory, and TauCeti's audits (`lake exe axioms`,
`lake exe module-system`) resolve `.olean`s through the Lean search path. Asking
for the copy keeps them working, and measured on a 1500-declaration module,
returning to a previously built state still fell from 4s of recompilation to 0s
of restore. The trade is disk: the store holds a second copy of what it caches,
and `lake cache clean` empties it all or nothing.

## `workers add` flags

`add` takes an optional id, defaulting to the next free `workerN`, and writes an
entry with `enabled = true`.

| Flag | Sets |
| --- | --- |
| `worker_id` | `id`; omit it for the next free `workerN` |
| `--agent AGENT` | `agent` |
| `--only TASKS` | `only`, as a comma-separated list |
| `--sandbox {host,bubble}` | `sandbox` |
| `--ignore-quota` | `ignore_quota`; use with an explicit subscription agent |
| `--auto-refresh` | `auto_refresh` |
| `--roadmap-only AREA` | `roadmap_only` |
| `--roadmap-skip AREAS` | `roadmap_skip`, as a comma-separated list |
| `--tend-scope {author,owned}` | `tend_scope` |
| `--max-open-prs N` | `max_open_prs` |
| `--source PATH_OR_URL` | `source`; also requires `roadmap` in `--only` and a non-empty `--roadmap-only` |
| `--author-model MODEL` | `author_model` |
| `--author-effort EFFORT` | `author_effort`; Codex, Claude, or Kiro only |
| `--pace CURVE` | `pace` |
| `--stream` | `stream` |
| `--isolate-home` | `isolate_home`; useful when the id is `default` |

`add` cannot set `roadmap_extra_identities`, `review_roadmap`, `review_pr`, `review_author`,
`respect_claims`, or `restart`, and always writes `enabled = true`. Use
`workers edit` for those.

## Actions

| Action | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| _(none)_ | Same as `status` |
| `status [--json] [--watch]` | Desired and actual state. Exits nonzero if the manager is offline or a wanted worker is not alive |
| `apply [--check]` | Validate the TOML schema and manager-level rules, then reconcile. `--check` validates only |
| `add [ID] [flags]` | Append an enabled definition and reconcile |
| `enable ID` / `disable ID` | Persist desired running or stopped state |
| `restart ID` | Request a restart without changing desired state; a disabled worker stays stopped |
| `remove ID` | Drop the definition and stop the worker |
| `logs ID [--follow] [--lines N]` | The durable console log. `--follow` continues across worker restarts |
| `tmux [--no-attach]` | Build the optional tmux viewing workspace |
| `manager [--interval N]` | Run the reconciler in the foreground |
| `manager-stop [--leave-workers]` | Stop the detached manager. By default it also stops its workers |
| `service ACTION` | `install`, `uninstall`, `start`, `stop`, `restart`, or `status` for the native user service |
| `edit [--editor CMD]` | Create or open `workers.toml` in an editor; it does not apply the result |
| `import LEGACY [--force]` | One-shot migration from the legacy `workers.conf` format; it does not start a manager |

`apply` without `--check`, `add`, `enable`, `disable`, `remove`, and `restart`
start a manager if none is running and return only after it accepts control
requests. `edit`, `import`, and `apply --check` do not start one.

## The manager, and running past logout

`workers apply` and related actions start a detached manager owned by the current
login session. To move an existing fleet to a native user service that survives
logout and comes back after a reboot, leave its workers running while the service
takes over the manager socket:

```bash
tauceti workers manager-stop --leave-workers
tauceti workers service install
tauceti workers service status
```

Omit `manager-stop` when no detached manager is running. One runtime directory
can host only one manager and one active configuration at a time. A reconcile
action that names a different `--config` file reports the conflict instead of
switching it.

That is a systemd user service on Linux and NixOS, or a LaunchAgent on macOS.
Two platform caveats:

- On Linux systems that stop the user manager after the last logout,
  `loginctl enable-linger "$USER"` keeps user services running with no login
  session.
- A macOS LaunchAgent survives terminal and SSH-session loss, but starts only
  after a graphical login. Installation says so explicitly when no GUI login
  domain is active.

At startup the worker preserves an explicit `SSL_CERT_FILE` or discovers the
host's system CA bundle, including NixOS's `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`,
so quota checks keep working when uv's standalone Python defaults to a different
OpenSSL trust store. A shell-provided Nix bundle carried into the service stays
a revalidated candidate rather than a pinned trust path, so garbage collection
cannot silently disable fallback discovery.

The reconciler and the worker control sockets are portable Unix code. No Linux
`/proc` interface is required.

## Worker ids and credential isolation

Every worker id namespaces its state, checkout, review store, logs, and Bubble
home. Workers coordinate through GitHub rather than sharing local mutable state,
so several workers can use one host without sharing a checkout. A maintenance
branch claim lives in the PR head repository, where the worker that can update
the branch can also maintain its lease; roadmap and progress claims use the
canonical repository by default. Review markers, claims, and compare-and-swap
push and PR helpers keep workers from overwriting one another when they select
the same target.

Every id other than `default` also enables credential isolation. On Linux and
other non-macOS hosts, the worker gets a private `$HOME` containing private
Claude and Codex credential copies. GitHub CLI and Git configuration remain
shared so the worker still acts as the operator's `gh` account. `--isolate-home`
applies the same isolation when the id is literally `default`.

The Lean build caches are handled outside that isolation, in two different
ways, because they are written differently.

Toolchains are shared outright: `$ELAN_HOME` points at the login user's
`~/.elan`, so one install serves every worker and your own checkouts. Installing
a toolchain takes a per-toolchain lock and lands by rename, so workers racing for
the same one is safe. Left per-worker, 22 installs covered 6 distinct toolchains.

Mathlib's `.ltar` cache is *not* shared as a download target. `lake exe cache
get` takes no lock, and in any checkout older than
https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/42752 it writes fixed-name
temporary files, so two workers downloading into one directory can leave a
corrupt `.ltar` under a name every later run trusts — including yours. Each
worker therefore downloads into its own `$MATHLIB_CACHE_DIR` under its state
directory, and before each round it exchanges *finished* files with the pool by
hardlink: it promotes what it fetched last round and takes a link to everything
the pool has that it lacks. A hardlink is atomic and an existing name is never
replaced, so the pool only ever gains complete artifacts, costs no extra disk,
and a worker downloads only what nobody on the machine has. Left per-worker
entirely, half of one week's 10.2 GB of `.ltar` traffic was a file another worker
already had.

`$LAKE_CACHE_DIR` stays per-worker too. It normally sits under the toolchain
directory, and would otherwise follow `$ELAN_HOME` into the pool, but unlike an
install it is written throughout every build. That also keeps a per-worker
`LAKE_ARTIFACT_CACHE` experiment honest, since the store it fills is that
worker's alone.

Setting any of the three yourself overrides this. `scripts/share-build-caches`
folds the private copies an already-running fleet accumulated into the pool
without re-downloading them.

On macOS, `$HOME` stays unchanged because both Claude Code and GitHub CLI use the
login Keychain. `tauceti` redirects `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and `$CODEX_HOME`, which
isolates Codex, but host workers still share the login user's Claude account.
Bubble rounds copy that shared Claude credential into a private transient
directory without modifying the Keychain. See [the sandbox notes](sandbox.md)
for that handoff.

What an isolated worker inherits is the credential, not your configuration. Its
`.claude` directory gets a `settings.json` of its own, no `CLAUDE.md`, and only
the one `pi` skill the worker itself dispatches through, so a round behaves the
same whoever ran it and your personal instructions cannot contradict the task
prompt. Edit that generated `settings.json` in place to tune a worker; it is
written once and never overwritten. `TAUCETI_INHERIT_CLAUDE_CONFIG=1` restores
the previous behaviour of sharing your own `CLAUDE.md`, settings, and skills,
including on a worker already seeded the clean way; a `settings.json` you have
edited is kept rather than replaced.

## State on disk

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `<state>/<id>.json` | Per-worker status, heartbeated every two seconds |
| `<state>/manager.log` | The detached manager's own console |
| `<state>/logs/<id>/work-*.log` | Durable per-run console logs |
| `<runtime>/manager.sock`, `w-<id>.sock` | Control sockets, mode 0600 |

`<state>` is `$TAUCETI_WORKERS_STATE_DIR`, else `$XDG_STATE_HOME/tauceti/workers`,
else `~/Library/Application Support/tauceti/state/workers` on macOS, else
`~/.local/state/tauceti/workers`. `<runtime>` is `$TAUCETI_RUNTIME_DIR`, else
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/tauceti`, else `/tmp/tauceti-$(id -u)`; it must be owned by you
and inaccessible to other users, or the manager refuses to start.

Each managed worker publishes a structured state such as `waiting-quota`,
`surveying`, `running`, or `backoff`, along with its current phase and target and
the path to its logfile. That is what `tauceti workers status` and the
dashboard's workers view read.

## tmux is a viewer, not the supervisor

`tauceti workers tmux` opens one dashboard window plus one log-following window
per enabled worker. Killing that session does not stop any worker, and running
the command again rebuilds the view from the configuration and the durable logs.
tmux is optional; workers run without it.

## Migrating from `workers.conf`

`workers.conf` is a legacy line-oriented format: one `tauceti work --loop`
command per line, each with an explicit `--worker-id`. It is only ever read by
the one-shot import, which refuses to overwrite an existing `workers.toml`
without `--force`:

```bash
tauceti workers import workers.conf
```

Anything the legacy parser does not recognize is an error naming the file, line,
and token, so a partial migration is never silently accepted.
